	The description is "Our destroyed carts are scattered around the area. It looks like the raiders took all we had. There are tracks and blood everywhere, but no bodies ... strange."
	Some destroyed carts are part of remains.
	The description is "[if waterskin is inside carts]Only thing I can find in one of the carts is an empty waterskin ... great.[otherwise]There is nothing left here, that could be of any use to me."
	Empty Waterskin is inside destroyed carts. The description is "Not a single drop left ..."
	Blood is here. Blood is scenery. The description is "Traces of blood are all over the place. My fellow travelers must have put up a good fight ..."
	Some tracks are inside the remains. Tracks are scenery. The description is "The tracks seem to lead off to the east. Maybe I should follow them for now."
	Instead of searching, say description.
